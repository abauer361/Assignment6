\section{Review}
The time differences were pretty much the similar, I attribute this to my small selection of numbers for my index. Trade offs when picking one algorithm over the other includes implementation, time taken to sort the array, and time taken/complexity it takes to create the program. Empirical analysis in this sense gave similar results given each small data type. With mathematical analysis, I can easily tell which sorting algorithm to use depending on the number of variables given for each array. Some way I could have improved this testing was through more sorting algorithms or a test of the difference between a small number of elements in an array vs a large number of elements.
